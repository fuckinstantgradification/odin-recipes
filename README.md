# odin-recipes
In this project I'll be using some new concepts I've learned. 
I will follow up on this "README" as I progress throughout The Odin Project.

Follow up 1.

I have added an image from another site, using an absolute link. 
Written ordered and unordered lists, linked to internal pages with relative links and used some different fonts and sizes.

Follow up 2.
Added a css folder and updated the index file. 
I'll continue to style the website with newly learned skills and keep practice using Github. 
I've changed some of the language in this README, with the intent of practice my documentation skills.
